                <strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
                God has created everything including land, water, air etc. Nature has several manifestations – benign as well as hostile. Sometimes, it is soothing, sometimes it is ferocious. Whenever it turns to be in its bad temper, it can bring about devastation which is known as disaster.<br><br>
                <strong>Definition:</strong><br>
                A disaster is a serious disruption in the functioning of a community and society as a fall-out of widespread human, material, or environmental losses that exceed the ability of the affected population to cope with its own resources.
                India is a disaster prone country. In fact, there is no country which is immune from disasters which can be classified as-<br><br>
                <strong>Classification of disasters:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>Natural disasters:</strong><br> These disasters caused due to natural reasons which are beyond the control of humans including floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcano eruptions that have immediate impacts on human lives.<br><br>
                <strong>Man-made disasters:</strong><br>These is also known as the complex emergencies are the disasters caused due to major accidents like fires, the breakdown of authority, looting and attacks, including conflict situations and war.<br><br>
                <strong>Disasters Management:</strong><br>Disaster management is a well-planned strategy for making efforts to reduce the hazards caused by the disasters. Disaster management though does not avert or eliminate the threats; it focuses on formulating plans to decrease the effect of disasters. In India, national disaster management authority (NDMA) has been set up to coordinate responses to natural or man-made disasters across the country. NDMA runs various programs for mitigation and responsiveness for specific situations.<br>
